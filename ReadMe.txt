Please note that our code requires CPLEX, Visual C++, and MATLAB compilers. Furthermore, it is required to link Visual C++ with CPLEX and MATLAB. Since these compilers are not linked in the IEEE codeocean, our codes cannot be run directly on the website. However, the code can be downloaded from the website and run with the above mentioned software.

To link Visual C++ with CPLEX, the following URL can be helpful:
